# Inter Process Service Interface- IPSI framework
IPSI framework is a library that allows multiple applications to connect and perform a service request. This framework abstracts the complex low-level system’s communication protocol by revealing a simplified service interface that can be used by the applications to invoke service requests to other applications.
## Product
**libipsi.so** - is our product that can be found in ipsi/bin
> Note: Please see [Building libipsi.so](https://github.com/parthoCarleton/Group_C_ipsiFramework/wiki/Developer-Reference#build-shared-library--libipsiso) manual to obtain libipsi.so
## Dependencies
Our product exclusively provide functionality under Operating System with Linux Kernel environment that has Dbus component.
For more information refer [Developer-Reference](https://github.com/parthoCarleton/Group_C_ipsiFramework/wiki/Developer-Reference) manual.
