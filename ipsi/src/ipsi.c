 *
 * Description: This is the core of IPSI-Framework library
 * that allows multiple applications to connect and perform service requests.
 * This framework abstracts the complex low-level systemâ€™s communication protocol
 * by revealing a simplified service interface that can be used by the
 * applications to invoke service requests to other applications.
 *
 * External API by IPSI-Framework:
 * int ipsi_connection_type(char *app_name,char *connection_name);
 * int ipsi_register_function(void (*fun_ptr)(), char *method_name);
 * int ipsi_method_call(char *app_name,char* method_name);
 * int ipsi_listen();
 * void ipsi_close();
