 * ELG 6179: ADV TOPICS IN SOFTWARE ENGINEER. (Software Development in C) [University of Ottawa]
 * SYSC5709F: Software Development with C [Carleton University]
 *
 * Description: This is the core of IPSI-Framework library
 * that allows multiple applications to connect and perform a service request.
 * This framework abstracts the complex low-level systemâ€™s communication protocol
 * by revealing a simplified service interface that can be used by the
 * applications to invoke service requests to other applications.
 *
 * External API by IPSI-Framework:
 * int ipsiConnectionType(char *appName,char *connectionName);
 * int ipsiRegisterFunction(void (*funPtr)(), char *methodName);
 * int ipsiMethodCall(char *appName,char* methodName);
 * int ipsiListen();
 * void ipsiClose();
