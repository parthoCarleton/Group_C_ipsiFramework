 *
 * Description: This is the core of IPSI-Framework library (Header File)
 * that allows multiple applications to connect and perform a service request.
 * This framework abstracts the complex low-level systemâ€™s communication protocol
 * by revealing a simplified service interface that can be used by the
 * applications to invoke service requests to other applications.
 *
 * External API by IPSI-Framework:
 * int ipsi_connection_type(char *app_name,char *connection_name);
 * int ipsi_register_function(void (*fun_ptr)(), char *method_name);
 * int ipsi_method_call(char *app_name,char* method_name);
 * int ipsi_listen();
 * void ipsi_close();

 *
 * Service requester Application should register itself as "Caller" and with a unique name, this will allow the
 * application to invoke service request to desired service provider.
 * Service provider Application should register itself as "Server" and with a unique name, this will allow the application
 * to server any service request and allow service requester application to invoke services with the unique name.
 *

 *
 * @param[in] connectionType: Specify the role of the application either "Caller" or "Server"

 * @return SUCCESS: The application as successfully registered itself with IPSI library
 * @return FAILURE: The application was unable to register with IPSI library , an appropriate error message will be shown on console
